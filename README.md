# ANOMALYZED-SENTINEL
Next-gen cybersecurity monitor powered by data analytics and machine learning.
##Overview
Anomalyzed Sentinel is an advanced cybersecurity and data monitoring system that leverages machine learning and intelligent analytics to detect abnormal patterns, identify potential security threats, and deliver actionable insights in real time.
The system acts as a digital guardian, continuously scanning network and user activity to identify anomalies that may indicate intrusion, fraud, or performance issues — ensuring systems remain secure, stable, and resilient.

##Features
🔍 Real-Time Anomaly Detection — Monitors data streams to detect irregular behaviors or suspicious patterns.
🧠 AI-Powered Analysis — Uses trained ML models to classify threats, anomalies, and performance deviations.
📊 Interactive Dashboard — Displays analytics and alerts through an intuitive Streamlit-powered interface.
🔐 Automated Alerts & Logging — Generates detailed logs and sends alerts for quick threat response.
⚙️ Modular Architecture — Easily extendable with additional cybersecurity modules or APIs.
☁️ Scalable Design — Suitable for small systems or enterprise-level infrastructures.

💡 Use Cases
Cyber threat detection and prevention
Fraud and irregular transaction monitoring
Insider activity or behavioral anomaly tracking
Network and system performance analytics
AI-assisted security reporting and insights

##System Modules
Threat Detection Engine – Identifies and classifies anomalies
Behavior Analytics – Tracks activity trends and deviations
Incident Logs – Records all detected events with timestamps
Dashboard Interface – Streamlit-based visualization and management
AI Learning Module – Continuously improves detection accuracy

##How It Works
Data Collection → Streams network or user activity data.
Preprocessing → Cleans, normalizes, and structures the data.
Anomaly Detection → ML models identify outliers or suspicious patterns.
Alert & Logging → Sends alerts and logs all incidents for review.
Visualization → Displays insights on an interactive dashboard.

##Dashboard Preview
The Streamlit dashboard visualizes anomaly scores, event timelines, and live metrics — enabling faster threat recognition and decision-making.

##Vision
To empower organizations and individuals with AI-driven intelligence that detects, predicts, and mitigates digital threats — ensuring safe and trusted digital ecosystems.
